### Hi, and welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is Dominik Nolde and I'm a mathematician from Germany.

Currently, I'm studying for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, and I'm also working on improving my skills in Python, SQL, git and machine learning.
I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and improve my current skills.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find various projects and code snippets related to my interests and studies.
Feel free to browse through my repositories and leave feedback or suggestions.
Thank you for stopping by!
